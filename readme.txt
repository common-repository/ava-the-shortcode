A minimal shortcode which allows you to easily display an avatar.

== Description ==

Ava is a minimal shortcode which allows you to easily display an avatar. All you need to do is type `[ava]` into a WordPress post or page. Doing this will display the currently logged in user's avatar.

To show a specific user, do this:
`[ava id="1"]`

To change the size and add an alt attribute do this:
`[ava size="32" alt="me"]` or `[ava id="1" size="32" alt="me"]` 

If you are comfortable editing your theme and with PHP you may also utilize this shortcode by using: `<?php echo do_shortcode('[ava]'); ?>`

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/ava` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Place [ava] in a page. 
4. Use CSS to make it pretty. 


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I style the avatar? =

With CSS.

= Okay. Could you be a little more specific? =

Try this first: `[ava class="whatever"]`

Then, put the following code where your custom CSS is:

`.whatever{border-radius:50%; width:50%;}`

Now, if that does not work, I recommend wrapping the shortcode in a span tag with a class. For example: `<span class="whatever">[ava]</span>`

Either way, you need to know some CSS/HTML basics.
